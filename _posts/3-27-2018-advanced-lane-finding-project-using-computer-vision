The Advanced Lane Finding project was about detecting car lanes using computer vision techniques such as perspective transform, color transform, edge detection, etc. I mainly used Jupyter Notebook and Python with the OpenCV library, and I had lots of fun implementing car lane detection logic that handles unexpected scenarios such as missing lane markers, shadow areas, etc.

Here is the video of the final result:
