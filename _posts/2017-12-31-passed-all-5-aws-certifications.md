By passing the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional, I have passed all the five core AWS certifications. Here is the list of the exams in reverse chronological order:

[su_table]<table>
<tr>
	<td>AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional (SAP)</td>
	<td>December 30, 2017</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional (DOP)</td>
	<td>December 29, 2017</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate (SOA)</td>
	<td>August 11, 2017</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>AWS Certified Developer - Associate (DVA)</td>
	<td>July 29, 2017</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA)</td>
	<td>July 25, 2017</td>
</tr>
</table>[/su_table]

As you can see from the above table, it took me about six months to prepare and pass the five certifications. I invested roughly 20 hours every week for six months to pass them. You may say it's a lot of time, and yes, it was. I don't know if the time that I invested was worth in terms of job opportunities because, after all, I believe recruiters treat certifications as just paper, and I believe AWS certificates are no different in that regard. But it didn't matter. For me, I had a clear goal. My goal was to understand the AWS technology deep enough so that I can utilize all the knowledge on my project at Nordstrom. At Nordstrom, I was responsible for architecting and designing a solution that handles every single online transaction 24x7 using AWS.

Even before preparing for the exam, I already had several years of DevOps experience with AWS. Studying the exams helped me deepen my understanding of the AWS, and I appreciated the opportunity to dedicate my time with the certifications. Studying for certification exams, in general, seems to provide an insight that I would never get through a regular job, and AWS certifications were no different in that regard. Well, I would say the only difference is that massive topics and the difficulty of the exams compared to other certifications.

Here are the several tips I'd like to share to increase the chance of passing the exam without failure:

#### Don't schedule an exam until you are ready.
I got this advise from Linux Academy, and this was a great tip for me. I am working full time with lots of other responsibilities, and the exams are very difficult. It is quite silly to add unnecessary pressure by scheduling an exam when you don't even know if you will be ready by that time.

So, instead, just keep studying. At some point, all of sudden, you know you are ready. For one of the AWS exams, when I finished work at 5 pm on Tuesday, I knew I was ready -- this realization appeared as extreme boredom while studying plus clear indication such as getting 100% marks on all prep tests. Luckily, the test slot was available at 6:30pm on the same day. I immediately scheduled an exam, drove from Seattle to an exam site in Bellevue, which took about 30 minutes, took the test, I passed the exam, and went home.

#### Read AWS Whitepapers and AWS Online Documentation
Online training sites such as Linux Academy and aCloud Guru are great, but as they already claimed, watching videos and doing hands-on labs from the Linux Academy and aCloud Guru is not enough, especially for the professional exams.

I loaded AWS whitepapers to my Kindle, and read while I was riding a bus. Most of whitepapers are fewer than 70 pages. So, even though it looks daunting at first, you will be surprised how fast you can finish them and how much information you can absorb from the whitepapers.

#### Bundle the Exam Topics
While Amazon provides five different certifications, they are all about AWS with a lot of overlaps among them. Instead of treating each exam as a separate goal to master, bundle the associated exams as a single topic, and the professional exams as another topic if you are planning to pass all five exams.

This is especially true for the AWS DevOps Professional Certification and the AWS Solutions Architect Professional Certification. I studied them together, and I was able to pass both of them in two days after I realized that I was ready to take the exam.

Good Luck with your study!
