### Why Meditation?
Why am I doing this? Stabilizing the mind, I am training my mind to be present.

#### Samatha (Mindfulness) Meditation
**Mixing the mind with space by following the breath.** Breath coming in and going out. Not concentrating on the breath but simply aware of it, riding it, following it out. Flash back to posture for grounding at any time.

* * *

### Seven Points Posture

- Legs crossed comfortably, knees lower than hips (if it chair, feet flat on ground, don't lean back, legs not crossed)
- Hands resting on thighs, or Zen mudra (palms overlapping). Drop your shoulders so that shoulders are completely relaxed.
- **Your back should be straight, held relaxed and lightly upright**
- Eyes are open, gaze resting on floor 4ft -- 6ft out in front
- Mouth slightly open, jaw is relaxed
- Tongue should rest lightly on upper palate, with the tip lightly touching the back of upper teeth
- Head straight like a string on a ceiling is attached to the top of your head

Settle into posture at the beginning.
Flash back to sense of being any time by noticing your posture
Feel your rear touching your stable base

### Three Steps of Meditation

1. **Settling:** This is a 2 to 5 minutes warmup before meditation. What is the quality of your mind? What did you bring with you to your seat?
Be clear when you are to start. Start with awareness.
Have a clear intention--stabilizing the mind
2. **Meditation:** Place the mind on an object. The object is the breath.
Notice when the mind wanders off. Bring your attention back to the breath. Continue this repeatedly as you sit.
3. **Post Meditation:** Bring your meditation experience to daily life such as speech, action, truth and compassion.

Repeat the step 1, 2 and 3.

### 3 Types of Discursive Thought

- Fantasy
- Briefly called off by a paragraph or two or a few lines.

<= Gently label these two as "Thinking" and return to following the breath

- Background thoughts rising up like bubbles from the mind

<= No need to do anything. Let them be.

Neither try to stop thoughts nor indulge them. "Touch and go." Allow thoughts to come up, notice them, let them pass. If you hear a critical voice when labeling thoughts, then next time label in a deliberately friendly way.

Begin with short sessions as you feel comfortable (5--10 minutes). Work up to longer sits. **Better to sit regularly every day rather than a very long session all at once.**
