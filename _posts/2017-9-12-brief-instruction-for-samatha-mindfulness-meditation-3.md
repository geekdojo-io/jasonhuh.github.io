_Note: This is my draft that I prepared when I provided mediation instruction while I was acting as a sub-teacher._

* * *

*Nirvana*

* Diamond axe - The diamond axe represents wisdom. The root of tree is your ego. River represents sufferings. The other side represents nirvana.

* __Nirvana__ is a cessation of consciousness that creates projection of thoughts. Nirvana itself is illusion, and it should be thrown away.

*General rules*

- Remember to bring your attention back to breath
- Be kind to yourself
- Confident that your meditation is beneficial for you and others

*Self Deception*

- Disappointment
- Don't be a hero

*Trying hard*

When you notice you are trying hard on following breath and your mind keeps wandering, give up trying hard. Surrender. Let go of trying hard to achieve anything. Doing so suddenly opens up to the present moment that is in front of you.

*Kill your ego with diamond axe*

While you are meditating, you may experience anxiety about your future, jealous about someone you know. When you look deeper, often, you find that this is an act of your ego. When you look deeper at your ego, you realize that your ego is just another thought. Let go of that ego and come back to your breath. You notice that the anxiety, jealous or any other feelings that were liked to that ego go away all together.
