Recently, I launched an education program ([Bellevue Code School](http://www.bellevuecodeschool.com)) that offers private programming classes to kids with age between 9 and 16. While the program is intended for in-person class, the website offers self-paced learning for kids who want to learn Scratch, Python, C++ and eventually programming competitions such as USACO by providing lecture nodes and reading materials. Last but not least, I review the submitted homework by students and provide feedback.

So, if you are interested in (or your kids are interested in) learning programming, feel free to jump into the course.

Here is the overall curriculum of Bellevue Code School:
